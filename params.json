You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website.\r\n\r\n#### User Stories:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAs a User\r\nSo that I can view my friends' pictures\r\nI want to sign up to Instagram\r\n\r\nAs a User\r\nSo that I can share my own pictures\r\nI want to post a picture with a title\r\n\r\nAs a User\r\nSo that I can easily find the most recently made posts\r\nI want to view all posts in chronological order\r\n\r\nAs a User\r\nSo that I can get more information about a post\r\nI want to see the post's author, time it was posted and all its comments\r\n\r\nAs a User\r\nSo that I can show how much I like a post\r\nI want to 'like' a post\r\n\r\nAs a User\r\nSo that I can share my own thoughts\r\nI want to comment on a post\r\n```\r\n\r\n## My Approach\r\n\r\nI set myself a **target** for this project which was to *make the app function and look as close as possible to the real Instagram website*. I wanted to challenge and prove to myself that I could build something similar to an app that is already being used on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThere were **two practices** that I focused on while building this project. The first was to take an **agile approach**. For this reason I broke the app down to the above **user stories** and then worked on each one individually (in a **TDD** approach of couse). This way I could build the app feature-by-feature.\r\n\r\nThe second practice that I focused heavily on was **git flow** i.e. *the agile approach of version control*. To achieve this, I always created a separate git branch (from master) for each new feature. I then made all commits to this separate branch and only once all tests had passed for that feature did I then merge that branch into master. This had significantly improved my git flow skills.\r\n\r\nOnce the app was fully built and tested I then worked on the **styling**. I wanted to make the app look exactly like Instagram and I'm glad to say that this has been achieved. I had used **HTML**, **CSS**, **Sass** and **Bootstrap** to complete the front-end.\r\n\r\nAs for **data storage**, I had integrated **Amazon's AWS/S3** service in order to store the images.\r\n\r\n## Directory Structure\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── app/\r\n│   ├── controllers/\r\n│   │   ├── application_controller.rb\r\n│   │   ├── comments_controller.rb\r\n│   │   ├── posts_controller.rb\r\n│   │   └── likes_controller.rb\r\n│   │\r\n│   ├── models/\r\n│   │   ├── comment.rb\r\n│   │   ├── like.rb\r\n│   │   ├── post.rb\r\n│   │   └── user.rb\r\n│   │\r\n```\r\n\r\n## App Usage and Features\r\n\r\nSnapshots of the app's features can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/hsheikhm/instagram_clone#app-usage-and-features).\r\n\r\n## Demo App\r\n\r\nVisit the link below to see a live version of the app.\r\n\r\n[Instagram Clone App](https://clone-of-instagram.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in)\r\n\r\n## Download Instructions\r\n\r\nFollow the below instructions on your terminal to download the app:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/hsheikhm/instagram_clone.git\r\n$ cd instagram_clone\r\n$ bundle\r\n$ bin/rake db:create\r\n$ bin/rake db:migrate\r\n$ rails s\r\n(visit localhost)\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
