<p>Build a clone of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> using Rails. You'll need <strong>users</strong> who can post <strong>pictures</strong>, write <strong>comments</strong> on pictures and <strong>like</strong> a picture. Style it like Instagram's website.</p>

<pre><code>As a User
So that I can view my friends' pictures
I want to sign up to Instagram

As a User
So that I can share my own pictures
I want to post a picture with a title

As a User

I want to see the post's author, time it was posted and all its comments

As a User
So that I can show how much I like a post

<h2>
<a id="my-approach" class="anchor" href="#my-approach" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Approach</h2>

<p>I set myself a <strong>target</strong> for this project which was to <em>make the app function and look as close as possible to the real Instagram website</em>. I wanted to challenge and prove to myself that I could build something similar to an app that is already being used on a large scale.</p>

<p>There were <strong>two practices</strong> that I focused on while building this project. The first was to take an <strong>agile approach</strong>. For this reason I broke the app down to the above <strong>user stories</strong> and then worked on each one individually (in a <strong>TDD</strong> approach of couse). This way I could build the app feature-by-feature.</p>

<p>The second practice that I focused heavily on was <strong>git flow</strong> i.e. <em>the agile approach of version control</em>. To achieve this, I always created a separate git branch (from master) for each new feature. I then made all commits to this separate branch and only once all tests had passed for that feature did I then merge that branch into master. This had significantly improved my git flow skills.</p>

<p>Once the app was fully built and tested I then worked on the <strong>styling</strong>. I wanted to make the app look exactly like Instagram and I'm glad to say that this has been achieved.</p>

<p>As for <strong>data storage</strong>, I had integrated <strong>Amazon's AWS/S3</strong> service in order to store the images.</p>
